# LightPi

I built this some years ago as a challenge to myself and to control my lights (RGB LED strip lights) from my phone.

In this repo I've included both the python scrips to run on a raspberry pi (addition hardware required) and the Android app which communicates with it.

The app provides somewhat realtime changes to the lights, favourites and some preset routines.
